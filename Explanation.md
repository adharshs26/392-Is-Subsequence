The code determines if string `s` is a subsequence of string `t` by using two pointers: `i` for tracking the position in `s` and `j` for tracking the position in `t`. 
It iterates through `t` using the pointer `j`. 
Whenever the character in `t` at position `j` matches the character in `s` at position `i`, it advances the pointer `i` to check the next character in `s`. 
Regardless of whether a match is found, it always advances the pointer `j` to continue traversing `t`. 
After finishing the traversal, if the pointer `i` has reached the end of `s`, it indicates that all characters in `s` have been found in `t` in the correct order, and the function returns `True`. 
If not all characters of `s` are matched by the end of `t`, the function returns `False`.
